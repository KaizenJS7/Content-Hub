# Content-Hub

Let's continue with the content hub and data connectors. If you look on the left side we have two blades, one for <b>Data connectors</b> and one for <b>Content hub</b>. Let's click on <b>Data connectors</b> first.

My view is actually empty and the we recieved a notification saying "<b>Data Connector with "content source = gallery content" have been removed.</b>" This is due to the reason Microsoft decided to get rid of data connectors blade long term and simply integrate it into <b>Content hub</b>. In my case there are zero connectors. If you deploy connectors before this dicision has been made, you will see the connectors that are enabled, but those will be moved as well.

<br />

In the <b>Content hub</b> we can actually see the connectors that are available for now. Not only that, you in fact get way more than just connectors, you get entire solutions. Solutions are basically what you see currently in the list and if we select a specific solution, let's go with <b>Azure Activity</b>. You see that there are several <b>Content types</b> associated with this solution and this is not only data connectors. We see that there's actually 1 <b>Data connector</b>, but his is also stuff like <b>Hunting query</b>, <b>Analytics rule</b>, and <b>Workbooks</b>. If we click on <b> View details</b>.

<br />

We get more such as the respective <b>Plans</b>. You also get <b>Ratings + Reviews</b> for the specific connector but that's the entire idea.

<br />

If we go back you see that this is not only existing for Azure Activity, but in fact we have stuff like this for 381 solutions in total, which is great because the content type is really from a user perspective, really what we are probably used to when we look at the Microsoft Store or maybe even an app store for iOS, for example it's really about downloading data that is available to us. Downaloading content is available to us and that we can utilize without having to build it on our own and basically reinvent the wheel. That's the entire idea of the <b>Content hub</b> to provide us with solutions to solve a problem that we have. For example, be that we want to monitor everything related to Azure Activity.

What we will do now is explore the filtering options. As we see on the top of the list, basically we have some options to filter through those hundreds of solutions. Let's start with the <b>Status</b> and what we see is the status on the provided solutions. In this example we only want to have the "Not Installed" solutions and we apply the filter. Next is the <b>Conetent type</b>, where we say we are interested in solutions that also come with "Data connector" but also want to have "Analytics rule" for the connectors, select those then click apply. For <b>Support</b>, we actually say we want those to be provided and supported by "Microsoft". We also deselect everything from the <b>Provider</b> side and look for "Microsoft". We select it and for the <b>Category</b> we actually say we want to focus on "Identity" because identity is considered like the foundation when we talk about cloud security, so we want to secure this first. After we see we actually have three connectors, three solutions that fulfill the criteria that we just provided and one of those looks pretty promising, which is <b>Microsoft Entra ID</b>. If we select this we see that we get 1 Data connector with regards to Microsoft Entra ID, 64 analytics rules, 11 playbook, and 2 Workbook.
